# Cangjie stdx

## Introduction

The extension library `stdx` is an extension module provided by the Cangjie programming language (i.e., a non-core standard library, but an official supplementary feature set). It is a key component of the language ecosystem, supplementing Cangjie with more practical capabilities covering multiple domains, including aspect-oriented programming, compression and decompression, security (secure encryption capabilities/message digest algorithms/Asymmetric encryption and decryption and signature algorithms/digital certificate processing functions), encoding and decoding (base64/hex/json/url), networking (http/tls), logging, syntax parsing, unit test extensions, concurrent programming model, non-local control operation and serialization.

## Operating Instructions

For APIs related to stdx, please refer to [API Interface Description](./doc/summary_cjnative_EN.md).
For relevant guidance, please refer to [Development Guide](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_docs/).

## Quick Start

This repository provides convenient scripts to quickly download and extract binary artifacts for a specific version.

### Linux/macOS

This requires `curl` and `unzip`. Please ensure these tools are installed in your environment.

Execute directly in your command line (note the arguments at the end, modify as needed):

```shell
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx/raw/dev/downloader.sh)" -- 1.0.0.1
```

### Windows

Before running the script, you may need to adjust the PowerShell execution policy (only needs to be done once).

Please open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then, run the script in a regular PowerShell window (note the arguments at the end, modify as needed):

```powershell
irm https://raw.gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx/raw/dev/downloader.ps1 -OutFile "$env:TEMP\downloader.ps1"; & "$env:TEMP\downloader.ps1" 1.0.0.1
```

### Parameters

-   `<version>`: **Required**. Specifies the version to download, e.g., `1.0.0.1`.
-   `-p <platform-arch>`: **Optional**. Specifies the platform and architecture. If omitted, the script will auto-detect the current system.
-   `-d <extract-dir>`: **Optional**. Specifies the target path for extraction. If omitted, it defaults to the current directory.

**Usage Examples:**

```shell
# On Linux/macOS, download the ohos-aarch64 version of v1.0.0.1 and extract it to the ./cangjie_libs directory
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx/raw/dev/downloader.sh)" -- 1.0.0.1 -p ohos-aarch64 -d ./cangjie_libs
```

```powershell
# On Windows, download the windows-x64 version of v1.0.0.1 and extract it to the C:\cangjie_libs directory
irm https://raw.gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx/raw/dev/downloader.ps1 -OutFile "$env:TEMP\downloader.ps1"; & "$env:TEMP\downloader.ps1" 1.0.0.1 -p windows-x64 -d C:\cangjie_libs
```

## Constraints

Support for building `stdx` in Ubuntu/MacOS (x86_64, aarch64), Cangjie SDK 1.0.0 and above versions, please refer to the [Build Dependency Tools](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_build/blob/dev/docs/env_zh.md).

Note: Future versions of this extension library may contain incompatible changes, and cross-version backward compatibility is not guaranteed. Please fully assess the version adaptation risks before use.

## Compilation and Building

### Build Steps

#### Configure Cangjie SDK

Configure the Cangjie SDK environment:

```shell
source <cangjie sdk path>
```

Execute the following command to verify whether the installation is successful:

```shell
cjc -v
```

#### Build Command

Download the source code

```bash
git clone https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx.git
```

Enter the project directory, and run the following commands:

```shell
python3 build.py clean
python3 build.py build -t release --target-lib=<absolute path of openssl lib>
python3 build.py install
```

1. `build.py clean` command is used to clear temporary files in the workspace.
2. `build.py build` command starts the compilation：

    - `-t` or `--build-type`，specifies the type of build artifact, which can be either `release` or `debug`
    - `--target-lib` specifies the openssl lib directory

3. `build.py install` ommand installs the build artifacts to the `output` directory.

If the compilation is successful, a product directory named target by default will be obtained in the project directory.

### Get More Help Information

For more information, please take a look at the [build.py](build.py) or use `--help`

### Integration Build Guide

For integration building, please refer to the [Cangjie SDK Integration Build Guide](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_build/blob/dev/README_zh.md).

## Instructions for use

`stdx` provides two types of binaries: static and dynamic. Both are used independently and developers can reference them according to actual conditions.

### Import stdx

Add the following configuration to the `cjpm.toml` file of the code project:

```toml
[target.x86_64-w64-mingw32]                                                     # System architecture and OS information
  [target.x86_64-w64-mingw32.bin-dependencies]
    path-option = ["D:\\cangjiestdx\\windows_x86_64_cjnative\\stdx\\dynamic\\stdx"] # The stdx path is configured according to the actual situation
```

explain:

- x86_64-w64-mingw32：This configuration item indicates the operating system architecture information of the machine where the code is compiled. This information can be obtained by executing `cjc -v`. Developers should configure according to the actual situation. For example, the output of executing `cjc -v` is as follows, and the configuration is `x86_64-w64-mingw32`.

  ```text
  Cangjie Compiler: 0.59.4 (cjnative)
  Target: x86_64-w64-mingw32
  ```

- x86_64-w64-mingw32.bin-dependencies：Please replace x86_64-w64-mingw32 in the configuration with the actual operating system information.
- path-option：`stdx` The path where the binary is located.

> **illustrate:**
>
> - `cjpm.toml` is the configuration file of the Cangjie package management tool CJPM. For details, please refer to the Cangjie Programming Language Tool User Guide.
> - The configuration method is the same for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
> - If you import the static library of `stdx` and use the crypto and net packages, you need to add `-lcrypt32` to the `compile-option` configuration item of `cjpm.toml` under the `Windows` operating system, and `-ldl` under the `Linux` operating system, because they need to rely on system symbols.

**Configuration example**：Assuming the development environment is Windows x86_64, import the dynamic binary of `stdx`, then the `cjpm.toml` configuration example is as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]

[package]
  cjc-version = "0.59.4"
  compile-option = ""
  description = "nothing here"
  link-option = ""
  name = "test"
  output-type = "executable"
  override-compile-option = ""
  src-dir = ""
  target-dir = ""
  version = "1.0.0"
  package-configuration = {}

[target.x86_64-w64-mingw32]                                                     # System architecture and OS information
  [target.x86_64-w64-mingw32.bin-dependencies]
    path-option = ["D:\\cangjiestdx\\windows_x86_64_cjnative\\stdx\\dynamic\\stdx"] # The stdx path is configured according to the actual situation
```

### Using stdx

In the Cangjie source code file that needs to use `stdx`, import the corresponding package provided by `stdx` through import, and then call the API provided by the package. The import format is:

**import stdx.fullPackageName.itemName**

`fullPackageName` is the package name given in [package list](./doc/libs_stdx_en/libs_overview.md#package-list), `itemName` is the name of a visible declaration or definition,  `*` means importing all visible top-level declarations or definitions, for example:

- import stdx.net.http.ServerBuilder：Import the top-level declaration of ServerBuilder in the net.http package of the stdx module.
- import stdx.net.http.\* ：Import the net.http package of the stdx module.
- import stdx.log.\* ：Import the log package from the stdx module.

### Usage Examples

Assuming that the developer is developing on Linux and wants to import the static binary of `stdx`, the `cjpm.toml` configuration reference is as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]

[package]
  cjc-version = "0.59.4"
  compile-option = "-ldl"
  description = "nothing here"
  link-option = ""
  name = "test"
  output-type = "executable"
  src-dir = ""
  target-dir = ""
  version = "1.0.0"
  package-configuration = {}

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
  [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.bin-dependencies]
    path-option = ["/target/linux_x86_64_cjnative/static/stdx"]  # stdx path is configured according to actual situation
```

Write code: Create an `HTTP` service using the `net.http` package.

```cangjie
package test

import stdx.net.http.ServerBuilder

main () {
    // 1. Build a Server instance
    let server = ServerBuilder()
                        .addr("127.0.0.1")
                        .port(8080)
                        .build()
    // 2. Register HttpRequestHandler
    server.distributor.register("/index", {httpContext =>
        httpContext.responseBuilder.body("Hello 仓颉!")
    })
    // 3. Start the service
    server.serve()
}
```
